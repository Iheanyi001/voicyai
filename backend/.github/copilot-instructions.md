This is a FastAPI backend for a voice cloning service. The service supports user authentication (free/paid), audio upload with duration checks, optional target voice upload (paid only), and a voice cloning endpoint that returns a generated .wav file. Organize code into app/ with routes, auth, utils, and voice_cloning modules. Use best practices for API security and file handling.
